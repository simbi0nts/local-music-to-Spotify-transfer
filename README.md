# local-music-to-Spotify-transfer
Automatic import local music into Spotify (Some songs may not be found)

me too lazy to explain, but here an example:
```
python.exe .\main.py -f "F:\MUSIC\MemeMusic" -p "Memes" -e '*.mp3' '*.aac' -o "output.txt"
```
and don't forget to fill config files!

Note: Some tracks might not be available in your region

(!) Note2: You also need ffmpeg ([Link](https://ffmpeg.org/)). And don't forget to add this open-source software project to your PATH variable!
